Q: Why does my game crashes when loading up/doesn't load up at all?
A: Remove levelhead, though apparently some versions of Levelhead don't have that problem. Not having patcher also causes this problem.

Q: Why does the gemstone macro not work for me?
A: Hop on an armadillo, then use it. I'm aware it's quite buggy for higher ping.
